# Profolio
My name is Mackenzie McClellan. Welcome!

I am a senior studying Computer Science at the University of St. Thomas. I will graduate this semester, December 2022. In February 2023, I will be pursuing a career in software engineering at Best Buy. I am originally from Brooklyn Park, MN, and graduated from Maple Grove Senior High in 2019. 

Throughout my time at St. Thomas, I've been given the opportunity to work on a multitude of projects. During this time, and in these three projects in particular, I have harnessed skills in Java, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, and jQuery. The first project, the St. Paul Crime Incidents Web App, is a single page application class project I contributed to. The second, the Security Venture Project, is a solo project of powerpoints and videos about Cyber Security. The third, OneU, is a start-up company's website I contributed to throughout the gALPHA program at St. Thomas.

This venture project was done with the alignment of OneU, a start-up company that's connection was made through gALPHA. With this partnership, I was able to create three powerpoints and three paired presentation videos on the necessary security for a start-up company with a growing cliental.
